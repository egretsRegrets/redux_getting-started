Describing State Change With Actions:

The second principal of Redux, is that the state tree is read only, you cannot change this representation of state by writing to it.

If you wish to change the state, you need to dispatch an action.

An Action is a plain js object that describes the change.

Just as the state tree is the minimal representation of application state, the action is a minimal representation of the change to state.

The structure of the Action object is flexible, the only requisite is a 'type' property which is not undefined. It's suggested that a string be used, since strings are serializable. The Action type could, if for instance we had a counter with increment and decrement buttons, be either 'INCREMENT' or 'DECREMENT'.
